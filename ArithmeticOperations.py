#Question 4 task 1
#Calculate store math. Calculate the total cost of three items you'd commonly find
# in the grocery store, given their individual prices. For example what would be the cost of
# bread, peanu butter, and jelly be? Prices don't need to be realistic

bread = 7
peanutButter = 5
jelly = 10
sum = bread + peanutButter + jelly
print(sum)

#Task 2 Bank interest
# if you have a savings account with a particular initial amount and a fixed yearly interest rate, 
# calculate the total amount in your account after a year. So if you had $10,000 at a 7% intest write
# code that would tell us the amoun at the end of the year. For the example the expected outcome
# would be $10,700

initial = 10000
interest = .07
dividend = initial * interest + initial
print (dividend)
